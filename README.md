This is basic implementation of jQgrid with angular 1.x.
It includes nested grid on expand of an item of grid.

To run it you just have to clone the repo and hit the command prompt with live-server.

If you do not have live-server installed, please follow the below steps.

1) npm install -g live-server
2) browse to the downloaded repo and run live-server :)

In case more advanced grid requirement occurs, may be I can help at amitauras@gmail.com
